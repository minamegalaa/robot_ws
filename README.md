# robot_ws
This project explores an autonomous vacuum cleaner using both differential and swerve drives. We employ RP Lidar A1 for mapping and navigation, integrating SLAM (Gmapping) and the ROS navigation stack for autonomous movement and obstacle avoidance. Includes URDF models, configuration files, and launch files for ROS.
